## 🚀 Play

### In your browser

**[openhistoria.com](https://openhistoria.com)** — nothing to install. Games are saved in
your browser, and you bring your own AI key (it goes straight to your provider, never to
us). The world map is served by the community [content-node network](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia-node).

Local AI (Ollama, LM Studio) needs one extra step in the browser: the server has to allow
the site's origin, e.g. start Ollama with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=https://openhistoria.com`. The
desktop app below needs no such setup.

### Desktop (offline, single-player)

Download **[`Open-Historia.zip`](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia/releases/tag/app-stable)**
(~186 MB — code *and* all map data), unzip it anywhere, then:

- **Windows:** double-click **`Launch Open Historia.bat`**
- **macOS:** double-click **`Launch Open Historia.command`** (first run: right-click → *Open*)
- **Linux:** run `./"Launch Open Historia.sh"` in a terminal

The launcher checks Node.js, downloads the map data, installs dependencies, builds,
and opens the game. To update an existing install later, run the matching
**`Update Open Historia`** script for your platform — it fetches the latest version
while preserving your saves, scenarios, and map data.

> [!TIP]
> Run the launcher **normally** — it does not need (and works better without)
> administrator rights: an elevated window gets the admin account's environment,
> which can hide a Node.js that was installed for your own account.

<details>
<summary><b>Windows says "Windows cannot find …Launch Open Historia.bat"?</b></summary>

The file exists — this is Windows' misleading message for a **blocked or broken
double-click action** on batch files, usually one of:

1. **A broken `ComSpec` system variable** (the launcher also warns about this
   when started from a terminal). In a Command Prompt run `echo %ComSpec%` —
   it must print `C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe`. If it doesn't: System
   Properties → *Environment Variables* → *System variables* → `ComSpec` → set
   it to `%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe`, then sign out and back in. Windows
   needs `ComSpec` to launch any double-clicked batch file, so a broken value
   produces exactly this error.
2. **Antivirus / SmartScreen blocking a downloaded .bat.** Before extracting,
   right-click the downloaded ZIP → *Properties* → check **Unblock** → *OK*, then
   extract to a simple folder like `C:\Games\Open-Historia` (not Downloads). If
   you already extracted, do the same on `Launch Open Historia.bat` itself, and
   check your antivirus' protection log / quarantine.
3. **A broken .bat file association.** Open a *normal* Command Prompt, `cd` into
   the folder and run `"Launch Open Historia.bat"` — if that works while
   double-clicking doesn't, restore the association from an **administrator**
   Command Prompt: `assoc .bat=batfile` and ensure the registry value
   `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\batfile\shell\open\command` is exactly `"%1" %*`.

Running "as administrator" sidesteps the block, but don't make that the routine —
see the tip above.

#### Android app (thin APK)

Easiest: download **`pax-historia.apk`** from the
[**Android release**](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia/releases/tag/android)
and open it to install (allow installs from your browser when Android asks).
It's a thin client: the game itself runs on whatever server it connects to, so you need
one of the two:

- **A desktop on the same network** running the launcher — type its address
  (e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:3000`) into the app once; it's remembered.
- **[Termux](https://termux.dev/) on the phone itself** running the server — the app
  finds it on first launch by itself, no address needed.

<details>
<summary>Build the APK yourself (needs the Android SDK)</summary>

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx cap sync android
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug   # gradlew.bat on Windows
```

The APK lands in `mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. (Or open
`mobile/android` in Android Studio and press Run.) Maintainers: the
**Build Android APK** action in the Actions tab builds and republishes the
release APK — run it after changing `mobile/`.

</details>

### Manual

Prerequisites: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 22 LTS or newer (minimum 20.19 / 22.12 — the client build runs on Vite 7, which requires it).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia.git
cd open-historia
node scripts/fetch-map-assets.mjs  # Download the world map data (see note below)
npm install                        # Install dependencies (includes OpenLayers etc. for the editor)
npm run build                      # Build the client
node server/server.js              # Start the server
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

> **Note:** the large map binaries (`*.pmtiles`, `public/assets/*-seed.*`, and
> `server/data/scenarios/default/regions.geojson`) are **not** in the repo — they are
> hosted as [GitHub Release assets](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia/releases/tag/map-data)
> and downloaded by `scripts/fetch-map-assets.mjs`. The launcher script for your platform
> runs this for you automatically, so a plain ZIP download works too — no Git LFS needed.

## 🌍 Scenarios

**Modern Day** is the only built-in scenario. All other official presets — *World War II — 1939*,
*Medieval — 1200 AD*, *Rome — 117 AD*, *Mongol World — 1300 AD*, *New World — 1650*, and
*Bronze Age — 1200 BC* — live on the
[**Scenario Hub**](https://github.com/Open-Historia/Open-historia-scenarios), pinned at the top of
the in-game **Community** tab. Import any of them with one click, or publish your own.

To rebuild an official preset from source (specs live in `scripts/presets/`):

```bash
node scripts/presets/build-preset.mjs scripts/presets/wwii-1939.spec.mjs
```

To regenerate the built-in Modern Day map: `node scripts/build-default-map.mjs`

## 🗺️ Map editor

Open any scenario's editor and click **🗺️ Open Map Editor** (or visit
`http://localhost:3000/?editor=1` for the standalone editor). Draw regions, split and
merge borders freehand, paint owners, import 70k cities, sign your map, then
**Apply & Play**.

## 🖥️ Host a server node

Want to help the network? Run a **content node** on your own device to cache and serve
the game's map data to nearby players so everyone loads faster. It's a one-click install
and deliberately safe — a node only ever serves **read-only, checksum-verified** map
files, and never touches anyone's games, accounts, AI keys, or code.

➡️ **[Set up a node → Open-Historia/open-historia-node](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia-node)**

Your node registers itself and starts serving players once an admin accepts it. See the
[node README](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia-node#readme) for the full
walkthrough (including a free Cloudflare Tunnel to put it online).
