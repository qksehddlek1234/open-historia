REM  Open Historia - one-click setup and launch

REM
REM  Just double-click this file. Keep the window open while

REM ---- 2. Ensure world map data ----------------------------
REM  The big map binaries (pmtiles, geojson, city seeds) are hosted as assets on
REM  a GitHub Release - free, unmetered bandwidth - instead of Git LFS, whose
REM  small free bandwidth quota a few installs used to exhaust. A fresh git/ZIP
REM  install no longer ships them, so this downloads any that are missing on
REM  first run. (Node is guaranteed present by step 1.) See scripts\map-assets.json.
echo Checking world map data...
if exist "scripts\fetch-map-assets.mjs" node "scripts\fetch-map-assets.mjs" --ensure
echo.

REM ---- 3. Install dependencies -----------------------------
REM Always run npm install: it's a fast no-op when nothing changed, but it also
REM installs any NEW dependency a code update added. Gating this on "node_modules
REM missing" skipped those, so a newly-required package (e.g. jszip) never got
REM installed and the production build failed to resolve it.
echo Installing / updating dependencies ^(fast if already up to date^)...
call npm install

REM ---- 4. Build the client ---------------------------------
REM Give Node extra heap so the production build doesn't run out of memory
REM on machines that are low on free RAM.
set "NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096"

REM newer than the last build). Previously this only built when dist was missing,
REM so after every update players had to delete the dist folder by hand.
