# Open Historia — Linux/Termux updater © 2026 Nicholas Krol, MIT (see src/Editor/LICENSE).

# ============================================================
#  Open Historia - one-click updater (Linux / macOS)
#  ----------------------------------------------------------
#  Replaces this install's files with the latest ones from
#  GitHub, without touching your saved games or settings.
#
#   - Git installs (folder has .git):  git pull
#   - ZIP installs:                    downloads the latest
#     code and copies it over this folder (needs rsync)
#
#  Either way the big map binaries come from the map-data GitHub
#  Release (scripts/fetch-map-assets.mjs), never from Git LFS -
#  its free bandwidth is 1 GB/mo org-wide and a handful of
#  installs exhausted it. They are not in the repo at all, so
#  neither a git pull nor a codeload ZIP carries them. See
#  scripts/map-assets.json.
#
#  What is protected:
#   * server/data/games        (your save games)
#   * server/data/*.json       (your library state)
#   * existing scenario files  (new ones are added, yours
#                               are never overwritten)
#   * public/assets/*.pmtiles  (your real map data is never
#                               overwritten by an update)
#
#  After updating, run "Launch Open Historia.sh" as usual -
#  it reinstalls dependencies and rebuilds automatically.
#
#  Run from a terminal:   ./"Update Open Historia.sh"
#  macOS: double-click "Update Open Historia.command" instead.
